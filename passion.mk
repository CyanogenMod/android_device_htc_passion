# The OpenGL ES API level that is natively supported by this device.
# This is a 16.16 fixed point number

## (2) Also get non-open-source GSM-specific aspects if available
$(call inherit-product-if-exists, vendor/htc/passion/passion-vendor.mk)

## (3)  Finally, the least specific parts, i.e. the non-GSM-specific aspects
$(call inherit-product, device/htc/passion-common/passion.mk)
